At the moment, I'm just developing this to support one of my own projects that uses Svelte as the presentation framework.
You'll want to review the tests for documentation until I have more time to write formal docs.

Also, I think the config API is fairly stable, but I will probably be restructuring the library a bit and possibly moving
toward more of a OOP-style API.
